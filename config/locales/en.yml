    title: About me
    description: "Hello, my name is Angel Huaman Rojas, I´m self-taught web developer. Actually, I live in Lima - Perú and I work in EterniaSoft. Most of my time was occupied in research and learn new ways to improve my abilities. In my free time I like to do mobile and web interfaces, if I´m not doing that, I go with my girlfriend to visit and explore new places, finding unique unforgettable experiences and take pictures. Also I go to meetups of technology, entrepreneurship and English."
